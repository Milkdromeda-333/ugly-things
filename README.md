### Ugly Thingz.
<hr>

This project is a website where you post ugly things. 

I used:
- axios library to make XMLHttpRequests
- React and its hooks to render the app and the changes that will occur
- ugly things API by V-school to host my data
- Git for version control

I learned:
- That there will be problems that will seen unsolvable, try to simulate the desired results.
- If you're feeling overwhelmed take a short break away from the computer and come back with a relaxed mind.
- carefully think through your problem when debugging.
- look back at the staged versions diff's to find what you changed if you broke the site after a lot of changes.
- That you should put media queries either underneath its co-responding code or at the very bottom of the stylesheet because the cascade still applies.
- To use git pull to sync the changes that isn't on my local machine with the remote version to solve a merge conflict.
